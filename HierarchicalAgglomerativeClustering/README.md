## Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering 

Write a program to implment HAC clustering.  

Note:  

    1. Documents are represented as normalized tf-idf vectors.  
    2. Cosine similarity for pair-wise document similarity.
    3. Similarity measure between clusters can be: single-link, complete-link, group-average, and centroid similarity.
