## Extract Terms  

Write a program to convert a set of documents into tf-idf vectors.  

You have to do:  

    1. Construct a dictionary based on the terms extracted from the given documents. 
    2. Transfer each document into a tf-idf unit vector.  
    3. Write a function cosine(Docx, Docy) which loads the tf-idf vectors of documents x and y and returns their cosine similarity.
